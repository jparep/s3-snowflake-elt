# ELT Pipeline using dbt, Airflow, and Fivetran for Extracting Data from S3 to Snowflake

## Overview

This project demonstrates an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline using dbt, Airflow, and Fivetran to extract data from Amazon S3 and load it into Snowflake. The pipeline is designed to be efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with access to S3
- A Snowflake account
- dbt installed (`pip install dbt`)
- Airflow installed and configured
- Fivetran account and connector setup
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Snowflake CLI or connection details

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/s3-snowflake-elt.git
    cd s3-snowflake-elt
    ```

2. **Configure dbt profile:**

    Update your `profiles.yml` file with your Snowflake connection details.

    ```yaml
    s3_snowflake_elt:
      target: dev
      outputs:
        dev:
          type: snowflake
          account: <your_account>
          user: <your_user>
          password: <your_password>
          role: <your_role>
          database: <your_database>
          warehouse: <your_warehouse>
          schema: <your_schema>
    ```

3. **Configure Airflow:**

    Ensure Airflow is installed and configured. Place the `elt_pipeline.py` DAG file in your Airflow `dags` directory.

4. **Configure Fivetran:**

    Set up a Fivetran connector to extract data from your S3 bucket and load it into Snowflake.

## Running the Pipeline

1. **Extract and Load:**

    Fivetran will handle the extraction of data from S3 and loading it into Snowflake.

2. **Transform:**

    Run dbt models to transform the data.

    ```sh
    dbt run
    ```

3. **Orchestrate with Airflow:**

    Use Airflow to schedule and manage the entire ELT pipeline.

    ```sh
    airflow dags trigger elt_pipeline
    ```

4. **Test:**

    Run dbt tests to ensure data quality.

    ```sh
    dbt test
    ```
